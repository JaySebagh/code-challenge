White Board Exercise
What will be printed if you run this? Why?


function test() {
   console.log(a);
   console.log(foo());
   
   var a = 1;
   function foo() {
      return 2;
   }
}

test();

------------------------------------

The first console.log would return ‘undefined’. Variables declared with var and that are called before they are defined get hoisted, initialized, and assigned undefined.

The second console.log would return ‘2’. Function declarations are hoisted and available to the entire scope.
If it was a function expression, const foo = function(), it would return a reference initialization error.
