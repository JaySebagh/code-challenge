##What’s the difference between const, let, and var?

‘Var’ is accessible in global scopes and function scopes.
‘let’/’const’ is accessible in global scopes, function scopes, and block scopes.

If you define ‘var’ inside a function, you cannot access it outside; however, if you define ‘var’ inside a block scope (such as a for loop) you can access it outside.

If you define ‘let’ or ‘const’ inside a function or block scope, it will not be accessible outside. 

‘const’ is like ‘let’, except it cannot be updated.

‘var’ is no longer widely used.
