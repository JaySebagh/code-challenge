White Board Exercise
What will be printed if you run the following code? Why?

----------------------------------------
var counter = 1;

function outerCounter(){
    counter++;
    var counter = 2;
  
    function innerCounter(){
        counter++;
        var counter = 3;
        console.log(counter);
    }
    
    innerCounter();
}

outerCounter();
----------------------------------------



What about if we remove the variable declarations inside the functions? Why?

----------------------------------------
var counter = 1;

function outerCounter(){
    counter++;
    
    function innerCounter(){
        counter++;
        console.log(counter);
    }
    
    innerCounter();
}

outerCounter();
----------------------------------------

1) It would return 3.
We call outerCounter that calls innerCounter which updates the global counter variable with 3 and console logs it.
Inside outerCounter, 'counter++' would update the global variable to 2. 'var counter' would update the global counter to 2.
Inside the innerCounter, 'counter++' would increment the global counter to 3. 'var counter' would update the global variable to 3.
Having both 'counter++' and 'var counter' is redundant as the latter would always replace the former in this order.

2) It would return 3. 
'var' has a functional and global scope. The variable can be accessed within functions.
If 'innerCounter' was outside of 'outerCounter' and the global 'counter' variable was inside 'outerCounter', it would throw error saying that 'counter' is not defined.
